# Vue.js rules

- Use the Composition API with `<script setup>` for better type inference and organization
- Define props with type definitions and defaults
- Use emits for component events
- Use v-model for two-way binding
- Use computed properties for derived state
- Use watchers for side effects
- Use provide/inject for deep component communication
- Use async components for code-splitting
